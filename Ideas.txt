- Looks like the majority of these issues are with the filesystem, we can write the program in terms of
  downloaded files (apt only)?

- Have the programming running when you download stuff, then you can check that way

-Pytest is used to ensure that the files were installed correctly, we can locate them, and that certain ones are
 properly sought out and removed and flagged


-1st detect when a new file is run on your computer, get a state of the filesystem
